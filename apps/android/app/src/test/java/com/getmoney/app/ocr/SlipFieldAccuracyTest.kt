/**

 * party names — against labels read straight off the slip images.
 *
 * spentAt and reference can be checked against the filename and the slip QR,
 * so they're covered by [SlipDateAccuracyTest]. These three cannot: nothing in
 * the file metadata knows what the transfer was worth or who it went to. The
 * labels come from `tools/slip_labels.json`, merged into the fixture by
 * `python tools/merge_labels.py`.
 *
 * Reports rather than asserts while the labelled set is small — a handful of
 * slips can't support a meaningful regression threshold, and a failing build
 * would say more about the sample size than about the parser.
